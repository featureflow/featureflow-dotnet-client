[![][dependency-img]][dependency-url]

.net client SDK for Featureflow compatible with Framework 4.5, .Net Standard 1.3 - 2.0.

Get your Featureflow account at [featureflow.io](http://www.featureflow.io)

## Get Started

The easiest way to get started is to follow the [Featureflow quick start guides](http://docs.featureflow.io/docs)

## Change Log

Please see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/featureflow/featureflow-dotnet-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

Using NuGet
```xml
Install-Package Featureflow
```

## Usage

### Quick start

Get your 'Server Environment Api Key' from the environment page in featureflow and instantiate a singleton client:
#### Instantiate the client
```c#
var client = new FeatureflowClient("srv-env-b4b1bdac23ac47558165851a96899019"); //

```
#### Evaluate a feature
In your code, you can test the value of your feature where the value of `my-feature-key` is equal to `'on'` 
```c#
  var result = client.Evaluate("example-feature", user).Is("on");

```

Because the most commonly used variants for any feature are `'on'` and `'off'`, we have provided two helper methods `.IsOn()` and `.IsOff()`

```c#

    if (client.Evaluate("example-feature").IsOn())
    {
	    //do something
    }
    if (client.Evaluate("example-feature").IsOff())
    {
	    //do something
    }    
```
### Setting feature failover values

The feature failover value is used if the feature is not found in the fatures cache for any reason.
The default value is 'off'. You may define your features in code and specify a failover value.
```
var client = new FeatureflowClient("srv-env-YOUR_KEY", new List<Feature>
		    {
			    new Feature
			    {
				    Key = "feature-one",
				    FailoverVariant = "unavailable"
			    },
			    new Feature
			    {
				    Key = "new-one",
				    FailoverVariant = "green"
			    }
		    }, new FeatureflowConfig());

```


### Adding a User
You can pass user information in to allow features to be targeted.
At the point in time of evaluation (e.g. on a rest call or other call) you can create and pass in a user by creating a `FeatureflowUser` object. We have a builder to help:

```c#
var user = new User("1234");
user.WithAttribute("region", "sydney");
user.WithAttribute("days", new List<object> {11L, 1L, 4L, 29L});
user.WithSessionAttribute("dayofweek", 11L);
var result = client.Evaluate("example-feature", user).Value();
```
User attributes can be of type `DateTime`, `Number`, `String` or `List<DateTime>`, `List<Number>`, `List<String>`

When a list of user attributes is passed in, each rule may match any of the attribute values, additionally each attribute is stored in featureflow for subsequent lookup in rule creation.

If you do not want the user saved in featureflow set '.saveUser(false)' on the FeatureflowUser object.
 
Evaluate by passing the user into the evaluate method:

```
var result = client.Evaluate("example-feature", user).Value();

```
